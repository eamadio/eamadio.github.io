Coming from digital electronics &amp;amp; embedded systems, I have a broad view on the digital ecosystem and I need a space where to show case my work and ideas. Having a github account is nice, but I wanted a place where I could publish articles online. It can be of any form like tutorial, blogs, reviews, editorials and much more.</description></item><item><title>How to set up this website using Hugo part2</title><link>https://eamadio.github.io/post/set-hugo-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eamadio.github.io/post/set-hugo-2/</guid><description>In part 1 we explored how I created a website using Hugo, now we are going to create a github action to automatically deploy the site on github pages when we create a commit.
Set up of Git repositories I created 2 GitHub repositories for the project:
First Repository for the hugo project eamadio.github.io.hugo Second repository to host my blog as Github User page eamadio.github.io You can find on a lot of articles who are using 2 differents branches of the same repository (&amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo; for the project, &amp;ldquo;gh_pages&amp;rdquo; for the generated static files), however I prefere to have two distinct repositories, each one dealing with a different concern.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://eamadio.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eamadio.github.io/about/</guid><description>It started with this, long ago Creative by nature, I enjoy solving problems and developing new digital solutions.
