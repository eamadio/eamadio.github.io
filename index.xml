Coming from digital electronics &amp;amp; embedded systems, I have a broad view on the digital ecosystem and I need a space where to show case my work and ideas. Having a github account is nice, but I wanted a place where I could publish articles online. It can be of any form like tutorial, blogs, reviews, editorials and much more.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://eamadio.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eamadio.github.io/about/</guid><description>It started with this, long ago Creative by nature, I enjoy solving problems and developing new digital solutions.
